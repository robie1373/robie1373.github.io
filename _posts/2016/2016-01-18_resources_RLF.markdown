# Using the cloud to make cheaper laptops viable - part 2

[Part 1]{%  /2016/2016-01-17-reducing_local_footprint.markdown %}

## the laptop

This was a bit of a touch choice. My goal was to find a machine that was appreciably cheaper than the fat alternative. I also want it to be resource constrained enough to really motivate me into working in the cloud. Not constrained enough to be crippled though. I don't want a rehashing of the netbook phase.

So, I eventually chose the Toshiba cb35-c3300. That's the 2015 version with the celeron proccessor, not the i3. It runs bout $330. That is pretty cheap compared to the $800 minimum for Macbook Air, and a hell of a deal compared to the MBP or the Surface 4.

## storage

## local apps -> containers

## local apps to web apps

## local apps to AWS et al

## wrap up
