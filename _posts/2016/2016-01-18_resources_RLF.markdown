# Using the cloud to make cheaper laptops viable - part 2

[Part 1]{%  /2016/2016-01-17-reducing_local_footprint.markdown %}

## the laptop

This was a bit of a tough choice. My goal was to find a machine that was appreciably cheaper than the fat alternative. I also want it to be resource constrained enough to really motivate me into working in the cloud. Not constrained enough to be crippled though. I don't want a rehashing of the netbook phase.

So, I eventually chose the Toshiba cb35-c3300. That's the 2015 version with the Celeron processor, not the i3. It runs bout $330. That is pretty cheap compared to the $800 minimum for Macbook Air, and a hell of a deal compared to the MBP or the Surface 4.

## storage

The Chromebook implies Google Drive. I'll definitely use some of that, but not exclusively. I use Dropbox quite a bit so that will come into play. That will probably be mostly for syncing things like password store because it wants to store everything locally. I will also be using some network storage at home and some variety of storage options in AWS.

## local apps to web apps

So far I haven't come up with any paid apps I need. I'm sure that will come.

## local apps to AWS et al

I will definitely be using some AWS compute power as well as some other cheap or free VPS systems. As I include them I'll add them to the list.

Amount  | Resource              | Unit Cost | Total Cost  | Comment
--------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|--------
1       | Toshiba cb35-c3300    | $330      | $330        |
100 GB  | Google Drive          |  ?        | ?           | Free for x months with purchase of CB
?? GB   | Dropbox               |   ?       | ?           | I pay for this anyway
