# Sourdough breadmaking

After reading [Flour Water Salt Yeast](http://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals-ebook/dp/B007SGLZH6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1457916682&sr=1-1&keywords=flour+water+salt+yeast) here is my schedule and plan.

While waiting for tubs etc. to arrive - Find flour. I think I would like to work with minimally messed with flour. As much as I hate the organic marketing, that does seem to be the way to start with mass market ingredients. It would be very cool to find a local source of slow milled flour. Not because it is likely to be any better, but because I like the idea of local ingredients. 

When 6 quart tub arrives - Start levain. 

  Day    | Time    | Keep  | Grams Flour     | Grams Water | Temp (F)  | Notes
  -------|---------|-------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-------
  1 Tue  | < Noon  | N/A   | 500 Whole Wheat | 500         | 90        | Leave uncovered for 1 - 2 hours. Cover and rest @ 75 - 90 if possible
  2 Wed  | < Noon  | 1/4   | 500 Whole Wheat | 500         | 90        | Same as Day 1. Should have expanded to almost 2 quart line with some bubles visible
  3 Thu  | < Noon  | 1/4   | 500 Whole Wheat | 500         | 90        | Same as Day 1. Later in day the smell should be pungent.
  4 Fri  | < Noon  | 200 grams | 500 Whole Wheat | 500     | 90        | Cover and rest.

  When levain is ready - Try a loaf!

  Day    | Time    | Keep  | Grams Flour     | Grams Water | Temp (F)  | Notes
  -------|---------|-------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-------
  5 Sat  | 7 <> 9  | 150   | 400 White, 100 Wheat | 400    | 85        | Target temp after feeding is 78 - 80.
  n...   | 7 <> 9  | 100    | 400 While, 100 Wheat | 400   | 85 -90 | adust amount retained and/or water temp based on room temp.
