# While the goal is to have almost nothing installed on the local machine, there are a few things that are going to be required. For now at least. This is a running list of things that I'm installing locally and why.

1. [Docker](2016-01-18-setting-up-docker-on-chromebook): Used to abstract away the ugly, dependancy ridden, environment polluting and otherwise uninstallable junk that I find myself using all the time. Like programming languages and network or security tools.
2. [Vim](2016-01-18-how-i-use-vim): A dude's got to edit.
3. [Crouton](2016-01-18-crouton-to-enable-RLF): By default the CB doesn't do Docker. Crouton allows you to run full Ubunto (or other linux) alongside ChromeOS. A bit heavy handed, but the best I could come up with.
