# Leavened Waffle Recipe

Waffles are fantastic. Waffletastic even. I love 'em. I wondered if I could make waffles with my leavain and a cheap, easy to store waffle iron. 

## The Iron

To that end I ordered a cast iron waffle iron. I really like lodge. They make great quality stuff, the pro-logic stuff comes with a fantastic season already applied, and the prices are spot on. Sadly, Lodge doesn't seem to sell a waffle iron. Foiled again. So instead, I ordered a Rome Old Fashioned Waffle Iron [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Romes-1100-Fashioned-Waffle-Iron/dp/B000BWCTL0?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00). I am fermenting my first batch of waffles even as I write this so I can't report on its efficacy yet. It did come wax coated and unseasoned, so I'm glad I got it a few days early.

A note on seasoning cast iron. I recently bought a Lodge pro-logic dutch oven for baking sourdough. I added a very, very thin layer of oil to the coating that was there and started baking with it. After about 3 cycles of 2 to 3 hours at 475, the pan was amazingly well seasoned. The coating was black and hard as you can believe. My take away was to start the pans life out with a thin coating and then put some long, very hot cycles through it before adding more oil. I think a lot of times, we put a layer of oil on every time, even if the last layer hasn't had time to cook down to a nice, hard carbon layer. I'm starting this waffle iron out with the same theory. I haven't been able to cook it quite as many times as I would like, but even so it has a better season than anything else I've been able to accomplish before.

## The recipe

Here is the recipe I'm starting with. This is iteration #1

The "Dry" team

Ingredient    | grams   | volume    | notes
--------------|---------|-----------|----------
Leavain       | UNK     | ~ 3 cups  | I forgot to weigh it. The volume was after I separated it and set it in the fridge to hold overnight.
Poolish       | UNK     | ~ 1/4 cup | Ditto
AP flour      | 160     | 1 1/4 cup  | 
00 flour      | 160     | 1 1/4 cup  | I'll probably replace this with AP next time.
Cornstarch    | 85      | 2/3 cup   |
{Sugar}       | {85}    | {5 TBS}    | I wish I had used honey. Add to the wet team instead.
Salt          | 25      | 1 TBS      |

The wet team

Ingredient    | grams   | volume    | notes
--------------|---------|-----------|----------
Whole Milk    | N/A     | 1 cup     | mix with buttermilk and warm to ~ 85&deg;
Buttermilk    | N/A     | 1 cup     | Ditto
{Honey}       | {85}    | {5 TBS}   | I will do this next time
Melted butter | UNK     | 1/2 cup   | 
Egg yolks     | N/A     | 6         | Whites reserved for next section

The "air" team

Ingredient    | grams   | volume    | notes
--------------|---------|-----------|----------
Egg whites    | N/A     | 6         | 
Sugar         | 34      | 2 TBS     | granulated needed to whip the eggs.
Vanilla       | UNK     | 2 TBS     | added to batter at last second
Almond extract | UNK    | 1 TBS     | added to batter at last second

### Process

#### Night before

  * Mix together a little bit of poolish. Store in the fridge if the room is warm
  * Set aside the levain

#### Morning of

  * Mix together flour, cornstarch, salt.
  * Warm dairy to ~ 85&deg;. Add melted butter, egg yolks, and honey.
  * Mix dry into wet.
  * Cover and ferment in warm spot for 3 - 5 hours. (Clearly these are brunch waffles. If you mixed the night before you could ferment in the fridge overnight.)

#### Last minute

  * Start heating up the iron on the stove top.
  * Whip egg whites and granulated sugar to medium peaks.
  * Add vanilla and almond extract to batter.
  * Fold in whipped egg whites. Mix 1/4 in quickly to loosen. Fold the rest in gently.


#### Bake

  * Spray iron with non-stick spray
  * pour 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter into iron. (Update after trying)
  * (Maybe) cook on first side for ~2 minutes and flip for ~1 or 2 minutes
  * (Optional) Whip a cup of whipping cream, 35 grams sugar, 1 tsp vanilla for topping.
