# Using crouton to enable the RLF process

There is lots of info on the tubes about installing crouton. Google that.

I'm using it because I really need Docker. I think. I can't see how I'm going to get around the need to do something like nmap locally. 

I think this is a reasonable compromise. It's way better than trying to run full VMs. Docker seems to do a bang up job with a tiny pile of compute resources so I am hoping it will make the tools I run with it feel snappy even on this light-weight box. 

Also, Docker is fun to use. I am finding some good use for it at work too.
